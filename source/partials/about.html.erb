          <p>Hi, Iâ€™m PedroðŸ‘‹ â€” a Full-Stack Developer based in Tokyo</p>

          <p>Born in Brazil and raised in Japan, I bring a multicultural perspective and a passion for building connections. During Le Wagonâ€™s intensive web development bootcamp, I built full-stack apps with Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, SQL, and I continue to build apps and websites to sharpen my skills and explore new ideas.</p>

          <p>Outside of coding, I enjoy working out, traveling, and taking on new challenges. Iâ€™m eager to keep growing as a developer and contribute to meaningful projects.</p>
